# 🔐 Secure File Sharing System (AES Encrypted)

This is a secure file upload and download system built using **Python Flask** and **AES encryption (CBC mode)**. Files are encrypted during upload and decrypted only during download, simulating real-world secure file transfer workflows.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ AES (CBC mode) encryption for file storage
- ✅ Encrypted file upload and download system
- ✅ Secure key handling (static demo key)
- ✅ Simple frontend (HTML + Flask)
- ✅ Handles any file type (.pdf, .jpg, .txt, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.10  
- Flask (Web Framework)  
- PyCryptodome (AES Encryption)  
- HTML/CSS (Frontend)

## 🔐 How Encryption Works

- AES in CBC mode with a 16-byte key (`securefileaes128`)
- Random IV (initialization vector) prepended to each ciphertext
- Padding used for non-16-byte-aligned file content
- Key is static for demo; in production use `.env` or vaults

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shahid455/FUTURE_CS_03.git
cd secure-file-sharing
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # (or source venv/bin/activate on Linux)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
